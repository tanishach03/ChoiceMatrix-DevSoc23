<p align="center"> An approach that uses performance-based
weighted voting mechanism. Our goal is to
improve decision-making by adjusting vote
weights based on how well the organization is
doing, giving a bigger say to those who
consistently show skill and dedication and
rewarding them in return by increasing their
weight for votes.

## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>
To setup a voting system for startup/organization to make policy/product changes to boost revenue/efficiency and changing vote's weight based on per quarter performance to maximize the targeted parameter of performance.

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>
<ul>
  <li>
    We implement a system where each employee has a weight of vote based on their position and department.
  </li>
  <li>
    Different departments work on different projects and propose the changes their projects make in product, the employees go through the proposals and vote for the project they find best.
  </li>
  <li>
    After every quarter of voting, the performance of product in market is analysed on various parameters and feedback from user is taken to conclude whether the changes in last quarter were positive or negative on product in market.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once analysed, the weight of votes are updated. Those who voted in favor of projects that brought positive impact get weight increased while those who voted for projects that brought negative impacts gets vote weight decremented.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some contraints are taken in consideration like the weight of lower position employee never comes very close to weight of the higher positon employee and the minimum that weight can go is equal to that of new joinee or the default weight of their position.
  </li>
  <li>
    This system helps to idenify the candidates deserving the promotion or demotion and can be used to reward those who contribute most to the company's progress
  </li>
</ul>

Once the ideal, reality, and consequences sections have been 
completed, and understood, it becomes easier to provide a solution for solving the problem.

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>
We can implement Machine Learning to further analyse the product performance in market and what could be improved, we can take this consensus mechanism to next level by implementing Analytic Hierarchy Process.

## üèÅ Business Aspects <a name = "getting_started"></a>
We can take this web app in market as a SaaS to help startups in quick and effective decision making. This can be a subscription based service.
